		<p>To make a start on the zine I went through some of Shakespeare's more popular woks I was familiar with and selected some significant passages. As the emoji translator I had made still has a limited number of words, I translated these passages manually in a word processor.</p>
		<p>Once I had the passages translated, I made a layout in Keynote to plan out the pages and get the font sizes and spacing right.</p>
		<p>At this point I considered that it would be better if the zine was more interactive, so I came up with the idea to add a DIY section, where people could either replicate emojis or design their own with stickers and translate a passage of their own. I decided to put this section in the middle so people would open to it easily if they were browsing at a market stall.</p>
		<p>I bought yellow and white round stickers so people could either make the classic face emojis with the yellow, or little drawings with the white. I used some different sticker paper backing to assemble appropriately sized sticker sheets with both the yellow and white circle stickers.</p>
		<p>I also wrote out some titles and designed the front and back covers and printed these, and translated passages to cut and paste.</p>
		<p>I then assembed everything into a master copy. I used bluetack to stick many of the cutouts on the pages as I wanted the shadows to be quite visible once photocopied.</p>
		<p>Once the master copy was fully assembled, I photocopied it to make the final zine pages. I stapled the pages, and then attached brown card pockets to hold the sticker sheet and pen for the DIY section.</p>
		<p>Below is the finished product on display at the Yami-Ichi presentation. Click <a href="page3.html" class="contentA">here</a> to read the zine.</p>
