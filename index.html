		<h3>Background to Project 4</h3>
		<p>This project began as an extension of Project 3, where I had made an online translator to translate Shakespearian passages into emoji stories.<br>
		Inspired by the Internet Yami-Ichi market featured on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjWJsE7B1cs">Back Streets of The Internet</a>, I wanted to take elements of my original concept and make it fit to sell at a marketplace, by taking it offline and back into print.<br>
		I decided to make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine">zine</a> as by design they are cut and pasted, and made to be easily redistributed by photocopier, something which happens online with emojipasta emoji stories.
